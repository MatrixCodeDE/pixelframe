## r/Place for hackers and computer scientists

#### Pixelframe is a rewrite of the [Pixelflut Project](https://github.com/defnull/pixelflut), compatible with Python 3.

I wanted to use the Pixelflut project for a university project, but I found out that it was written in Python 2, which is heavily outdated, so I created this.

<h1>Features</h1>

Since this is a rewrite of the entire original project, I also added some features the old one has not.
## ‚ö°Ô∏è Fast Base
Based on numpy, the new heart of the canvas is almost **6x faster&#42;** than the old version. It is also very efficient in performing actions on large data like a picture with metadata for every pixel.

> &#42;Based on calculations

## üñº Webinterface

Shows the canvas in a browser
Can display the current canvas, also featuring the integrated Documentation on /docs and /redoc

## üñ• Local Display

Displays the canvas on a local display connected to the host. \
PyGame isn't exactly a new feature, but its optional now. Also, you can display a stats bar for connection details and basic stats of the canvas when using in public.

> Note: this feature requires a host with graphic drivers, e.g. Docker containers won't work!

## üìü API

Based on FastAPI, can update pixels and also hosting the [Webinterface](#-webinterface) \
Usage [Coming Soon]

## üîå Interactive Sockets

Like the old version, this project uses sockets to communicate with the players. You can set pixels, get pixel colors and even view stats for the whole canvas. New features are a timeout for the connection and a cooldown for spam protection.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Config

A config for creating templates and sharing them, made easy.
